# TAO Delegation Portfolio Analysis Report

**Analysis Date:** January 10, 2026
**Wallet Size:** 175 TAO
**Strategy:** Long-term TAO Accumulation
**Priority:** Capital Preservation Over Yield Maximization

---

## Executive Summary

This report presents a diversified delegation portfolio for 175 TAO, optimized for sustainable accumulation while prioritizing capital preservation. Following the Tenex (SN67) exit scam that resulted in $2.8M in delegator losses, credibility assessment is weighted heavily in all allocation decisions.

## Scam Risk Assessment

### Critical Exclusion: Tenex (SN67)

**Status:** EXCLUDED - EXIT SCAM
**Credibility Score:** 0/100

**Red Flags Identified:**
1. **Instant Fee Change Mechanism** - No timelock on validator parameters allowed 99% fee extraction
2. **Pseudonymous Team** - Team members vanished after rug pull
3. **$2.8M Stolen** - Delegators lost all staked TAO
4. **Deregistered** - Subnet removed from network following incident

**Lesson Applied:** All portfolio selections require verified timelocks or multisig governance.

### Borderline Subnets Requiring Monitoring

| Subnet | Credibility | Risk Factors | Recommendation |
|--------|-------------|--------------|----------------|
| oneoneone (SN111) | 30.2 | Very high APY, newer subnet, limited track record | Avoid until proven |
| Graphite (SN43) | 46.3 | High APY variance, unverified sustainability | Monitor only |
| Root (SN0) | 45.0 | Lower yield but extremely stable | Limited allocation only |

### Accumulation Score Formula

```
Accumulation Score = (Credibility × 0.55) + (APY_Normalized × 0.25) + (Stability × 0.20)
```

Where:
- **Credibility (55%):** Subnet credibility score (0-100)
- **APY_Normalized (25%):** min(100, (30d_APY / 60%) × 100)
- **Stability (20%):** Nominator count, stake volume, APY consistency

## Monitoring and Rebalancing Guide

### Key Metrics to Track

| Metric | Current Value | Review Threshold |
|--------|---------------|------------------|
| Blended APY | 14.5% | Below 10% sustained |
| Credibility (per subnet) | All > 75 (core) | Below 60 |
| Validator uptime | 99%+ expected | Below 95% |
| Take rate changes | 0-9% current | Above 15% |
| Nominator count | Healthy | >30% decline |

### Rebalancing Triggers

**Immediate Review Required:**
1. Any subnet credibility drops below 60
2. Exit scam indicators (sudden fee increases, team silence)
3. Validator downtime exceeding 48 hours
4. Smart contract upgrades without timelock
5. Key team member departures

**Quarterly Review:**
1. Re-run full credibility assessment
2. Compare APY performance vs. projections
3. Check emission schedule changes
4. Review new subnet opportunities
5. Assess portfolio concentration

### Emergency Procedures

If exit scam indicators detected:
1. **DO NOT PANIC SELL** - Evaluate calmly
2. Verify information from multiple sources
3. Check if validator take rate changed
4. Review recent smart contract transactions
5. If confirmed threat, undelegate immediately (21-day unbonding)
